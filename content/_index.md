Software developer and (former?) mathematician living in Brooklyn, 
NY, United States.

## Software ~~~ General

- [Hoard](https://github.com/jamespfennell/hoard)
  is a distributed fault-tolerant system for collecting data feeds, 
  written in Go. 
  I currently have a 
  [two](https://hoard1.transitdata.nyc) 
  [replica](https://hoard2.transitdata.nyc) deployment collecting NYC transit data.

## Software ~~~ Transit

- [Transiter](https://github.com/jamespfennell/transiter) is a web service that subscribes to realtime transit data 
  feeds and provides views on the data through a REST API. 
  [Demo site](https://demo.transiter.dev).
  
- [PATH Train GTFS Realtime](https://github.com/jamespfennell/path-train-gtfs-realtime)
  is a Go application that
  generates a GTFS Realtime feed for the PATH train system in
  New York and New Jersey.

- The [realtimerail.nyc React webapp](https://www.realtimerail.nyc)
  displays train times for the NYC Subway. 
  Despite being branded, it's fully open source 
  ([repository](https://github.com/jamespfennell/realtimerail.nyc-react)).


## Software ~~~ Typesetting

When I was doing research mathematics I got into typesetting and 
created one thing people have found useful:

- [Linux and Mac installer](https://github.com/jamespfennell/mathtime-installer)
  for Michael Spivak's MathTime Professional 2 fonts for Latex. There's a free version of the fonts, so you have no excuse to continue using the overbearingly ubiquitous Computer Modern.

## Mathematics

I obtained my PhD in mathematics from the Courant Institute, 
New York University, in 2018.
My adviser was Pierre Germain. 
My thesis is entitled 
_Two topics in the theory of nonlinear Schrödinger equations_
([PDF download](/JamesFennell-PhDThesis.pdf)).

Doctorate publications:

- Equivariant heat and Schrödinger flows from
  Euclidean space to complex projective space 
  ([Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08188)).
- Resonant Hamiltonian systems associated to the 
  one-dimensional non-linear Schrödinger equation with harmonic trapping 
  ([Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08190)).
